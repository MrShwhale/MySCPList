# MySCPList
A google chrome extension which allows users to easily keep track of, rate, and note, articles on the SCP wiki.

This is still in early development. Right now, the only thing that it can really do is track/rate SCPs. I hope to style it properly soon, and then later add more features such as user lists.
If you have any feedback, or want to help development, email me: wapatmore@gmail.com.
