# MySCPList
A google chrome extension which allows users to easily keep track of, rate, and note, articles on the SCP wiki.

This is still in development. 
If you have any feedback, ideas, or want to help development, email me: wapatmore@gmail.com.

# Features
- Add any wiki page to either the "Completed" list - for if the user has read them, or the "Reading List" - for things you plan on getting to later.
- Each entry automatically records the url, author, page title, and time added to the list, as well as storing a user's notes on the article and a rating from 1-10 (for completed articles)
- Easily see and delete entries in either list
- Importing/exporting your list data

# Screenshots
- (Coming soon)

# Known bugs
- When an author whose name has the string " and " in it writes a page alone, the two halves of their name will be recorded individually.
  - I have some ideas on how to minimize this bug as much as possible, but it might never work properly with multi-author groups.
- Pages that do not have licenseboxes on them do not have their authors recognized.
  - I am working on a fix for this using the page history.
